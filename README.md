### Introduction & Project Goals ###
 This project is a simple drinking game, for those who love a simple drinking game and do not carry a pack of cards on them for anytime they go drinking. This website will be easy for people to access so they can play a simple yet fun drinking.

 This project is part of my Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. It is the second one I have created and is the one that I have most enjoyed making so far.

 The main requirements for this project were to create a web program that includes HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## UX ##

### User Stories ###  
As a User, I want:
* Attractive colours that are easy to see.
* Easily legible writing.
* Simple rules.
* Easy way to reset the game.
* Distinct pictures.
* Time to read the winning message.
* Ability to play without a timer to allow a large group to play.
* Have fun while playing.
* Easily clickable cards.
* To not have to scroll to find the game.

### Development planes ###  

To make sure that I was achieving these goals, I worked with my family over Christmas to see how we felt about a game such as this.

### Design ### 
The Design of this game was originally going to be a fun kids game based on funny looking animals, however during the making of this game, my grandfather passed away and he did enjoy having a drink and drinking games. 

This game is one page, so theres no scrolling to find the game. Its uncomplicated as nobody wants to jump through hoops to paly a simple game.

* Fonts  
  
  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pushster): font-family: 'Pushster', cursive;.  
  I chose this font as I thought it sticks out yet remains elegant which looks nice with the deep purple.

* Colours  

I picked the colors by picking colors using the dropper feature on the image that i chose that covers the cards to pull everything together.

### Features ###  

This Memory Game should be working across all screensizes so it can be used on a phone, tablet or computer. 

Features that have been implemented:  
* Memory-game  
  Let`s the user play a memory game with twelve cards, and by flipping them try to find all matching pairs.  

* Reset button  
  Let`s the user reset the game to play again.  

* Easy to navigate on all screensizes  
  By making the layout look the same by adding responsivnes, it is easy for the user to navigate on all screensizes.

  GitHub link takes the user to the developers GitHub page.  

Features that I want to implement in the future:  
* Increased difficulty
* Fully Styled Alert button
* Sound when boxes in Memory Game are pushed

  5. Under "Source" click the drop-down menu labelled "None" and select "Master".  
  6. Select "save", and the page will automatically refresh meaning that the website is now deployed.  
  7. Copy the deployed link to your live website!  

  ### Forking the Repository ###  

  By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:  
    
  1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").  
  2. Locate the [GitHub Respository](https://github.com/Carhul/ms2-kids-memory-game "Link to GitHub repository").  
  3. At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork".  
  4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
